# What is this?

The best description for what this is currently can be found [on my blog](http://allarsblog.com/2015/12/07/Custom-UE4-Marketplace-Frontend/).

It is written in about a day, very badly, by me, someone who doesn't javascript often. I committed many programming sins, see if you can find (and pull-request) them all!

# How Do I Use It?

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Allar/custom-ue4-marketplace-frontend/releases), download, extract, and run Marketplace.exe.

# How Do I Build It?

To build this, you're going to need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You will also need a copy of [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/).

Pull down the repo, run `npm install`, then run `c:\nw\nw.exe .`

Replace `c:\nw\nw.exe` with where ever you put your NW.js.
